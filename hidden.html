        <h1>The Capybara Hack</h1>
        <p>
            Lately, my capybaras have somehow infiltrated my system. For weeks now, a GIF has been mysteriously appearing on my screen at random times. It's becoming increasingly tiresome, and I can't seem to get rid of it.

            P.S. I suspect they’ve found a way to bypass my usual checks, possibly by altering their "identity". Normally, I check their operating system and which browser they are using, but it seems they’ve found a way to slip past those usual markers, modifying how they present themselves to the system and evading my filters.
